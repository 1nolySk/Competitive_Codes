# Competitive Codes
This is the right place for some cool code dumps, which i have solved on various coding platforms.

1. **Triple Sort - May Long Challenge 2020 Codechef | MAY20 <br/>**
Question - [Triple Sort](https://www.codechef.com/MAY20B/problems/TRPLSRT)<br/>
Most of you might have done the code for - _Minimum swaps to sort an array_. This question is bit different as if requires us to take 3 index at a time i,j and k(might not be ordered) and perform right shift on i, j, k. **Doing triple sort we need to tell if an given array can be sorted in m(input) times and also print your choice of triplets**. <br/>
This question did require me to think a lot and finally after doing some rough work i could think of a logic to do this and showed a pattern so finding the triplets also became easier.

2. **Max Dot Product Of two Subsequence - Weekly Contest 190 Leetcode<br/>**
Question - [Max Dot Product Of two Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-dot-product-of-two-subsequences/)<br/>
This problem looks complex on first view, but with a Dynamic Programming approach this problem becomes easy. This requires us to maximize the dot product and so DP seemed a suitable option for this problem.

3. **Roads in Chefland - May Cook-Off 2020 CodeChef | COOK118B<br/>**
Question - [Roads in Chefland](https://www.codechef.com/COOK118B/problems/CROADS)<br/>
This problem is more of mathematics and pattern analysis. After which the time complexity of code reduces to O(log(n)).

4. **The Tom and Jerry Game - June Long Challenge 2020 CodeChef | JUNE20B<br/>**
Question - [The Tom and Jerry Game](https://www.codechef.com/JUNE20B/problems/EOEO)<br/>
The problem requires a small analysis and we can then code it in O(log(n)).
